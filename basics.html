<h1> Interneting is easy!</h1>
<p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>


<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Heading define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p>

<p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
        an ordered list</li>
    <li>This is a new item</li>
</ol>
